                                &nbsp;RunningEvents is a platform created to promote and help organizing running
                                events. The platform has an authentication and authorization system, through which
                                authenticated users can enroll to events. Administrators can create new events,
                                update the events' information and register the statistics concerning the athletes'
                                performance (their timestamps at each stage of a race). Accessing this data, the platform
                                calculates the events' classifications automatically, allowing to filter the rankings according to
                                competitive category and gender.<br>
                                &nbsp;This platform is a RESTful WebApp implemented with the SpringBoot framework. The server-side
                                layer makes use of Java for the business logic and the database was built with PostgreSQL and Java
                                Persistence Architecture (JPA). The front-end consists in HTML, CSS and Javascript (jQuery library
                                is widely used for requests to the server). Twilio Sendgrid API is used to send emails to the users,
                                currently just to verify their accounts. <br>
                                &nbsp;The platform can be accessed through <a href = "https://running-events.herokuapp.com/">this link</a>.
                                The <a href="https://github.com/lucasmelz/runningEventsPublic">GitHub repository</a> contains the whole code

                                &nbsp; The graphic interface was built with animations drawn to

                                of the game is entirely programmed with JavaScript. In short, the
                                game consists in moving the main character (a cop) up and down pressing
                                the 'w' and 's' keys with the goal of hitting the blocks with a stick.
                                The game ends when a block touches the body of the police officer or
                                if a block reaches a position where it couldn't be hit anymore.

                            The Mosaic Problem: Java solution using dynamic programming
                            </span>
        <span class="mini-data" id="mosaicDescription"><br>
                                &nbsp;The objective of this program is to calculate how many different
                                combinations of pieces may result in the same pattern in a mosaic.
                                In this case we have pieces with 9 different sizes (1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 1x4, 1x6, 1x8, 1x10, 1x12, 1x16),
                                and those pieces can only be used horizontally. By receiving a description of the drawing pattern
                                in a mosaic as input, the algorithm calculates how many different ways the mosaic can be built with
                                the given pieces.

                                &nbsp;Different techniques can be used to solve the mosaic problem. It could be solved
                                through 'brute force', testing and counting all possible different combinations of pieces
                                that can build a sequence of colored pixels with a certain size. Another possible approach
                                is through recursion, calling the same function over and over for consecutive smaller parts
                                of a sequence. However, the recursive solution implies in a unnecessary repetition of calculations.
                                The optimal solution, therefore, is through dynamic programming, which means subdividing the
                                problem in smaller parts, as the recursive approach does, but avoiding repetitive computations
                                by storing the results of previous calculations in an <i>Array</i>.
                                &nbsp;The code can be seen below and the program can be executed through the
                                JDoodle plugin. To execute it, write on <i>Stdin Inputs</i>, in the first line,
                                two number separated by spaces, the number of rows (R) and the number of columns (C).
                                The R following lines should contain each a sequence of C characters. Dots represent
                                empty or blank spaces on the mosaic and letters represent colored pixels. Then, just
                                click on <i>Execute</i> and the result with be shown on the terminal.

        <span class="mini-data" id="busQueueDescription">
                                    &nbsp;Developed in the context of a discipline about Data Structures and
                                    Algorithms, the objective of this project is to efficiently implement a
                                    queue in a bus stop. A group of people arrives at a certain time.
                                    The groups that arrive next are placed in the end of the queue.
                                    The number of people is an attribute of the group, but it is possible to
                                    have a group with just one person. Buses can arrive to the bus stop, and each
                                    one of them has a determined number of seats. Everyone waiting will get in the bus
                                    until there are no seats left. If necessary, a group of people can be broken down
                                    in smaller parts, meaning that some leave and others stay in the queue. When the bus
                                    leaves, the average waiting time is calculated. When the program is initialized, we should
                                    type the date when the records will be made, following the format "DD MM AAAA". After that, to
                                    record the arrival of a group of people, we should type the letter P, the current hour,
                                    minutes, and the number of people, for instance, "P 10 00 30" (a group of 30 arrive at 10:00).
                                    To register the arrival of a bus, we should type the letter B, followed by the hour, minutes and
                                    number of seats ("B 10 00 30"). To verify how many groups are waiting in the queue, their respective
                                    sizes and time of arrival, type Q. You can visualize the files of the program, compile and execute it through the JDoodle online
                                    IDE <a href=https://www.jdoodle.com/a/4gGa>clicking here</a>. All you need to do is go to the bottom of the
                                    page, select the interactive mode, clicking on "execute" and the typing the commands in the terminal.
                                    The project is also available
